//I waited until the last minute for this project because I was really nervous, and it shows. I didn't find my way to the actual precourse work until a week before the classes, and had just been studying the precourse work before the exam....so I didn't get much time to look through and work on the actual precourse, if I had reached out for help it would have been better, unfort/ I have been very busy trying to get my life ready for the course and I wasn't as curious as I should have beem.
here is a link to the jsfiddle I was working on along with github for this https://jsfiddle.net/VirtualVeteran/5jefcz4k/62/
